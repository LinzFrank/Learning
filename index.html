              <p>Does your website offer users the best experience possible? Some websites were built without regard to the user. Hire us to do some user research, and propose recommended design and coding updates. Sometimes a few simple tweaks, targeted and backed by research, can make all the difference.</p>

            <h4>South Dakota State-wide Title III Consortium</h4>
            <p>This new website was built for a new program that supports students who speak English as a Second Language in K12 schools, and provides training for the teachers, and school districts that serve them. It's funded by a governement grant so the style needed to reflect trust and stability over intrigue and invitation - less corporate, and focused more on the main purpose of the site - it's a place for 81 school districts to download documents and share resources.

            <p>Barbara is a counselor by profession, with a unique side hustle: she makes stained glass. Her art has grown into a burgeoning business over the years, so she asked if we would build her a simple landing page.
